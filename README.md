# NLP - Sentiment Analyzer Project

This GitHub repository shows how I build my Sentiment Analyzer app step by step. This app consists of supervised and unsupervised models like TextBlob, VADER, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machine to predict sentiment. It also allow the user to: import, analyze, and download csv files containing sentiment and performance metrics between models.

This app was created using Google Colab, Python and Streamlit. 

You can "Spotify.csv" and "movie_reviews.csv" to test the app.
