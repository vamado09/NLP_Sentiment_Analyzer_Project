This NLP GitHub repository presents the systematic development process of our Sentiment Analyzer app, chronicling each step taken. Our app incorporates an array of supervised and unsupervised models, including TextBlob, VADER, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, Gradient Boosting, and Random Forest, offering a comprehensive sentiment prediction capability. Moreover, users can seamlessly perform tasks such as importing, analyzing, and downloading CSV files that contain sentiment data and performance metrics, fostering a robust user experience. Group names can be seeing within the App Menu selection. To facilitate testing, the "Spotify.csv" and "movie_reviews.csv" CSV files are readily available for download within the "Releases" section. Notably, our "app.ipynb" notebook acts as a graphical user interface (GUI) for the Sentiment Analyzer, allowing users to explore the app's features step by step.

Important: For optimal performance and stability, I strongly recommend utilizing the "app.ipynb" Colab notebook. This choice ensures that your resources won't be constrained, in contrast to the Streamlit Cloud web app, which has the potential to experience crashes due to resource limitations. However, if you wish to explore the Streamlit Cloud app for testing purposes, simply copy and paste the following link: https://vamado09-gui---sentiment-analyzer-app-7nykrt.streamlit.app/
